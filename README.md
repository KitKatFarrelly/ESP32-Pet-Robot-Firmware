# A new project!

bet you didn't see this coming! the lidar project with the epc611 turned out to be a bust,
So here is my new project! This repo holds the code for my pet robot project which I have
been working on and off (mostly off >~<) for around a year now. The schematic and PCB
will be in a seperate repository like with my last project. I'm hoping this project will
be a bit more succesful than the last one.

# HOW TO USE THIS REPO

create a new ESP_IDF project then copy the files in this repo into the main folder.
After that you need to set the target device you are flashing to and writing your
preferences into the menuconfig. I'll write a detailed tutorial later once things
actually are working a little bit.
