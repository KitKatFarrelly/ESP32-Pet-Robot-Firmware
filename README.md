bet you didn't see this coming! the lidar project with the epc611 turned out to be a bust,
So here is my new project! This repo holds the code for my pet robot project which I have
been working on and off (mostly off >~<) for around a year now. The schematic and PCB
will be in a seperate repository like with my last project. I'm hoping this project will
be a bit more succesful than the last one.
